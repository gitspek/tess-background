# tess-background
Repository for animations of background light in TESS cameras.  The animations show mean background, measured in 256x256 pixel blocks, in all four TESS cameras. The location of Earth, Moon, and major planets are shown in a polar projection.  The "back.mp4" files show the raw sky level after bias frame subtraction.  The "diff.mp4" files show the additional background light caused by the Earth or Moon.  The "diff.mp4" files are created by subtracting an image from each orbit when the Earth and Moon were both below the level of the sunshade (aka TESS darktime).
